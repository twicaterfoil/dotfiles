# dotfiles
Somewhere along the way, i stumbled upon [this page](https://dotfiles.github.io) about having dotfiles as git repos so they can be shared with others and also (hopefully) eliminate a lot of the pain of setting up a new machine. This repo exists as a collection of my dotfiles used on my machines. It's a work in progress as i migrate everything over to this single place.

This repo is largely based on [@holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) with stuff added, removed, and tweaked for what works well for me.

At the moment, configuration and installation is self contained in the `/script` directory, though this may change for a different dotfile management setup.

## Installing

To just update everything locally from what's in this repo, run the root level `dot-install` script from this repo.
